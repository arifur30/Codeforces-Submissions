Welcome to the "Codeforces Submissions" repository! Here, you can find my solutions to various Codeforces problems, written in C++, C, or Python. The repository contains solutions using two different file naming conventions: the default format generated by the Codeforces Past Handle (CPH) extension and a custom format including the Contest Number, Problem Serial, and Problem Name.

## File Naming Conventions

1. **Default Format (CPH Extension):**
   - Example: `A_Escalator_Conversations.c`, `B_Preparing_for_the_Contest.cpp`

2. **Custom Format (Contest Number, Problem Serial, and Problem Name):**
   - Example: `228A - Is your horseshoe on the other hoof.c`, `1511A - Review Site.c`

Feel free to explore the solutions, and if you have any questions or improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

## Structure

The repository is organized by languages (C++, C, Python) and further categorized by the naming convention used. This structure aims to provide a clear and organized view of the solutions.
